Scrabble 



# In this project, we will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. 
# We'll use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]
letter_to_points ={key: value for key, value in zip(letters, points)}

# Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles, so we add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.

letter_to_points[" "] = 0

# We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.

def score_word(word):
  point_total = 0
  for letter in word:
    point_total += letter_to_points.get(letter, 0)
  return(point_total)

# Test of this function:

brownie_points = score_word("BROWNIE")
print(brownie_points)


# Now we'll create a dictionary called player_to_words that maps players to a list of the words they have played. 
# This table represents the data to transcribe into our dictionary:

# player1	wordNerd	Lexi Con	Prof Reader
# BLUE		EARTH		ERASER		ZAP
# TENNIS	EYES		BELLY		COMA
# EXIT		MACHINE		HUSKY		PERIOD


player_to_words = {
  "player1" : ["BLUE", "TENNIS", "EXIT"],
  "wordNerd": ["EARTH", "EYES", "MACHINE"],
  "Lexi Con" : ["ERASER", "BELLY", "HUSKY"],
 "Prof Reader" : ["ZAP", "COMA", "PERIOD"]
}

print(player_to_words)

player_to_points = {}
for player, words in player_to_words.items():
  player_points = 0
  for word in words:
    player_points += score_word(word)
    player_to_points[player] = player_points
print(player_to_points)

# player_to_points should now contain the mapping of players to how many points theyâ€™ve scored!
