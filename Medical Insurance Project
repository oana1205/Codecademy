# Given the curiosity about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs, I'll be using a formula that estimates a persons's yearly insurance costs. The different factors will be investigated to check how each one of them is affecting the prediction.

# creating the initial variables below
age = 28
smoker = 0 #1 if smoker 0 if not a smoker
sex = 0 #0 if female, 1 if male
num_of_children = 3
bmi = 26.2
# Adding insurance estimate formula below
insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Checking contribution of age Factor
age += 4
# calculate the new insurance cost
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
# calculate change between the new insurance cost and original insurance cost
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print("The change in cost of insurance after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Checking contribution of BMI Factor
age  = 28
bmi += 3.1
# calculate the new insurance cost
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
# calculate change between the new insurance cost and original insurance cost
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing BMI by 3.1 is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Checking contribution of sex factor (Male/Female)
bmi = 26.2
sex = 1
# calculate the new insurance cost
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
# calculate change between the new insurance cost and original insurance cost
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print("The change in estimated insurance cost for being male instead of female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Checking contribution of smoker factor
sex = 0
smoker = 1
# calculate the new insurance cost
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
# calculate change between the new insurance cost and original insurance cost
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print("The change in estimated insurance cost for being a smoker is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")

# Checking contribution of num_of_children factor
smoker = 0
num_of_children = 4 
# calculate the new insurance cost
new_insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500
# calculate change between the new insurance cost and original insurance cost
change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost
print("The change in estimated insurance cost for having one more child is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
